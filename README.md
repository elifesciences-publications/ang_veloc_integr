Angular velocity integration
----------------------------

The code is written in Python 3 and requires the following packages:

* SciPy
* NumPy
* Matplotlib 2

The code is divided into several scripts.
`veloc_integr` is the main script and gives the profiles, velocity curves,
etc. It links with the library `Ornstein_Uhlenbeck.py` which generates
artificial input velocity traces.
The script `plot_traces.py` plots these generated traces. Finally, the scripts
`analysis_linear.py` and `plot_lin.py` refers to the analysis of the angular
integration linearity.
